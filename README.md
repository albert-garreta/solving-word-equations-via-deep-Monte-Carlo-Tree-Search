# Word equations, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and string solvers

**Important**: I wrote this code a while ago when I had little idea on good coding practices for easy debugging, shareability, and maintenance. As a consequence, this code is most likely hard to read/use. I may redesign the repository later in the future but for now this is not on me priority list.

Source code for the paper "[Solving word equations via Monte Carlo Tree Search and black-box solvers](https://github.com/agarreta/we-uct/blob/master/we-uct.pdf)".
